CBSh61340,"The guns are not a problem. Period. The idea that we have a ""gun problem"" is a fabrication by media organizations pushing an agenda.

We have always had guns. Semiautomatic guns have been common for a little over a hundred years now and repeating arms (lever-action, pump-action, etc) longer than that. Yet we haven't always had mass shootings, and overall violent crime rates - including *gun* crime - are lower than they've ever been.

 Moreover, access to guns doesn't show increased incidence of crimes in peer countries with comparatively liberal gun laws - Switzerland and New Zealand, for example, have minimal problems with crime despite having pretty liberal gun laws.

And gun control doesn't affect crime rates. The Aussies are often pointed to by the gun-ignorant as a success story, but the actual truth is that studies cannot conclude that their gun bills had a meaningful impact on crime, the compliance rate for those bills was very low, they have more guns in circulation now than before the bills (yet crime continues to be lower than ever), and they had mass shootings after Port Arthur. In the US, our 1993 AWB did absolutely nothing about crime and Columbine happened *during* it (and many more mass shootings before and since have used weapons legal to own under those bills.)

TheTazTurner,"Yes. If the person has views that overlap with mine and has given me reason to believe they would do their best to improve our country. Most importantly, I want them to express an intent to approach disagreements between opposing parties with civil, and productive discussion. Having Republicans refuse to pass a bill because it is drafted by Dems and vice versa,  is so petty. 


I really want a climate that when people disagree, it isn’t met with attacks and insults toward the other party. Its met with a willingness to hear out the other side and openness to work together to solve our differences. Unfortunately that would require politicians to put pride and ego aside, which for many of them are the exact traits that drew them to politics and pursuit of power.  

I mean the marketing of debates is almost like promo for a boxing match and they’re always about digging up dirt and it really gets nasty. To me it’s obvious the 2 party system is set up to be divisive, and it’s been accomplishing that goal since long before 2016. The more we fight the other side, the harder it is get anything done. It clear that very few of our politicians really care about us or want whats best for us. They want whats best for maintaining power, control and serving their own personal interest. Having a population that’s fighting makes keeping control that much easier. 


I’m not saying I know the solutions, because I really don’t know shit. I just know we’d have a much better chance at figuring this out and improving this country by working together instead of attacking the other side. It doesn’t make them more likely to agree with you, just drives them away and less open to hear out someone else representing your side of the argument.  

I have an idea, and it probably a stupid one but screw it. What if we require that bills must be drafted equally by both parties? Force them to work together with civility, have face to face discussions and find common ground. It’s not that hard, it happens all the time in the real world. 

Damn this was a long ass reply lol 

TLDR: We all on the same team yo, let’s stop letting the elites convince us we have no common ground.

> Former Microsoft CEO and co-founder Bill Gates recalls in newly revealed footage how President Trump once left an equestrian event in Florida and returned in a helicopter to make what Gates described as a ""grand entrance.""

In a video obtained by MSNBC and aired Thursday night on ""All In with Chris Hayes,"" Gates can be heard telling an audience about his personal experiences with Trump, whom he said he met only after the real estate mogul won the 2016 election.

But Gates recalled that Trump spoke with the Microsoft CEO's daughter Jennifer at an equestrian event in Florida, and was ""super nice.""

""But then, twenty minutes later, he flew in in a helicopter to the same place, so clearly he had been driven away and he wanted to make a grand entrance in a helicopter,"" Gates said in the clip.",etb29on,t1_et94u1t,1562635184.0
