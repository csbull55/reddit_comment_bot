ryencool,"I honestly think that's the reason this guy got such a sweet deal, and it has been so big in the news that it will NOT happen again, atleastin Epsteins case. 

My hope with this current case is that people are held accountable and a billionaire pedophile is put away for life. This needs to be the start of a wave of holding wealthy people to the same standards as the rest of us. I honestly tell people if I had one question I could ask trump and he had to answer publicly? It might be ""do you think you play by the same rules the majority of the population has to? Or are you above that"". The fact is wealthy people have the money/lawyers/connections/resources that basically operate as a shock and awe to our system. I have no doubt that people were ""hooked up""? Paid, or threatened with kompromat in this case. This is an extreme case but I'd wager moat wealthy individuals just have the cash to hire the right lawyers and the resources to fight most any battle. 

It's just sad that someone with weed could be in jail longer than this pedophile. They basically said they didnt have enough evidence to prosecute the 53 pages of felony crimes they had him on the hook for. The fact is they did have the evidence and people need to be held accountable. 

The fact that they found child porn IN HIS SAFE IN THE HOISE THEY RAIDED SATURDAY means this guy really gives no fucks. I highly doubt he got less worried after his experience a decade ago. They kept names secret and gave out immunity deals to people who basically ran his pedo operation, and they had evidence of all of that. I'm sure he felt sorry for his cohorts and add the secrecy/immunity to his deal as a final ""thank you"". I would wager he still has contacts with these people, and highly likely the operation continued in some capacity. He probably stayed away for a bit, but a billionaire pedo who isnt being treated has tons of time and resources? Probably went back to his habit. 

Anyone who was raped, groomed, or abused after his original case? The original lawyers and everyone involved should be held responsible, and as co conspirators. They new this guy was a predator, they had hyper detailed accounts and evidence, and they barely slapped his wrist. Those people are scared for life and this dude is jet setting around to his islands and Europe etc...

GiraffeandZebra,"Even by the worst metric possible (registered democrats/people of voting age), democrats rank as 30% of the population. (72M/235M)

That’s a pretty inaccurate measure though. You can’t say whether unregistered people are democrats, Republicans or anything else. They could all favor democratic policies. Or not. It’s a good bet they are roughly split at least similarly to the general population. It would probably even be a safe assumption that more given that young people and minorities who typically lean liberal are the most likely to be unregistered. But even with the conservative 30% assumption, that makes another 25M or so who support liberal views. 

And then of course, there’s the two plain and simple truth that most independents aren’t really independents. I’ve not met a single “independent” in my life who didn’t still mostly agree with one of the two parties on policy most of the time (barring libertarians maybe). 

So I guess my point is two fold. First, that even by the worst metric the number is greater than 25%. Second that many democratic views represent the views of a lot of people not necessarily labeled as democrats, so saying that legislating their policy is only what 25% of people want is really inaccurate.",etb1tbr,t1_etazuap,1562634847.0
